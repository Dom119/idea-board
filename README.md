Let's build an idea board!


**Talking Point**:

- A lot of modern JavaScript is focused on knowing the right tools for the job. Today, we'll be pulling in everything we've learned about React to build a full-stack application.



## Idea Board

We're going to build our own idea board using `create-react-app` with a pre-built back-end server. This allows us to fully understand our application and prevents us from introducing code we haven't written and don't understand.

## Data Model Brainstorm

Work with your classmates to:

- Write three user stories.
- Sketch two wireframes.
- Illustrate what your data model might look like. Think about the API routes required. What components do you think you'll need? What routes should be available to the React app?
